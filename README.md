# sqlalchemy-challenge

By Emanuel Emahazion

In this analysis we run SQL Alchemy to access SQL data, the pythonic way.


We use SQL alchemy with python to connect to a SQLite data base.

From there we run a climate analysis on the given data for station precipitation and temperature data. Once the data is extracted, and analyzed, we make bar charts and histograms to visualize. We then take it further into designing a Flask API in order to access desired parts of the data, in a JSON format.
